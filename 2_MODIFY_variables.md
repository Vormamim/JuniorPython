# Variable Assignment - Modify

#You can combine variables with strings in an output

name1 = "Axl"
name2 = "Slash"
#Add 2 more variables to store 'Duff' and 'Izzy'

#This line uses concatenation to join the variables together with the string 'and' to make a sentence.

#Complete the line to output all of the variables 
print(name1 + " and " + name2 + " and ")
```

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- print does not have a capital letter
- The string text is surrounded with speech marks
- The string (including speech marks) is surrounded by brackets.
- Variable goes on the left, data on the right for assignment.
- You've used a '+' between each string and variable that need concatenating.
